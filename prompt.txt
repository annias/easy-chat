###

write me js which will read aloud all the text in a <p>, highlighting each word as it is spoken. use boundary events from SpeechSynthesisUtterance to synchronize the highlighting with the speech.

make it into a html doc with inline js and put some sample text in a <p> that will be read when clicked
