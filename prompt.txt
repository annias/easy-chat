###

Put SPANs around every individual word in all the messages by default.
This way they can be clicked on and styled independently.
When the user clicks on any word in the chat history, highlight *just* the word that they clicked on.
Do not highlight the whole message.
Only require a SINGLE CLICK not a double click.
